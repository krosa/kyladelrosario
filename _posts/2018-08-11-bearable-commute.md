There are days when I have to make the hour-and-a-half commute to work (both ways). Though I'm exhausted when I come home, I hardly notice the time when I use these apps:

* [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp) for my ebooks and audiobooks
* [Libby](https://meet.libbyapp.com/) for borrowing ebooks and audiobooks from the library
* [RBdigital](https://rbdigital.com/) for borrowing magazines from the library
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for music
* [Castbox](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for podcasts
* [Netflix](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for movies and shows

I try to consume media mindfully. I look for books, podcasts, and shows that enrich my life and help me expand my knowledge. Boredom is rare for me. When the mood strikes, I'll watch something fun and silly like Bob's Burgers. It's important to laugh.

Because I spend a lot of time commuting, I avoid using these apps when I do get home (except for Netflix with my partner). Home is mostly for physical books, journaling, and board games. I figured if I limited my app usage to my transit hours, commuting won't be a waste of time.
