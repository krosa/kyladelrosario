I journal. I use a fountain pen and glide across the page. Call me an old soul. Blogging, especially daily blogging, has never appealed to me because I'm not on my computer 24/7. I like to step outside and take a walk. I disconnect from social media once in a while.

So, why am I coming back to the blogosphere?

I like a challenge. Participating in the real world also means sharing my ideas and the lessons I've learned. The blog is the perfect platform. Blogging will train me to express myself better. It will help me organize my thoughts. In a couple of years, I'd like to look back on past blog posts and cringe because I've grown and changed so much.

This is a good place to start.
