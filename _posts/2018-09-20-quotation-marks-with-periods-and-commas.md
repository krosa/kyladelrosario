**Q: Should I place my periods and commas inside or outside quotation marks?**

That depends what style of English you follow. If you follow the British style, periods and commas can go inside or outside the quotation marks. But if you follow the American style, periods and commas stay inside the quotation marks. For example:

> **British style:** He recommended the podcast episode, "#15: User research, tech writer stereotypes, and conversations".

> **American style:** He recommended the podcast episode, "#15: User research, tech writer stereotypes, and conversations."

**Q: What if I'm Canadian?**

Hey, I'm Canadian too (eh)! Canadians combine British and American spelling rules. In this case, we follow the American style: periods and commas go inside quotation marks1.
