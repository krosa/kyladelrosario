While browsing through a tutorial online, I came across a link that said, "View guide." The guide could have been a video or an article. I wasn't sure what to expect. Since I was sitting in a quiet caf√© without my headphones, I hesitated to click the link in case it was a video tutorial. Some of them auto-play!

If the link had said, "Read guide," I'd expect an article and would have clicked it instantly. You might think I'm being picky because _view_ and _read_ are similar enough. But _view_ is synonymous with _watch_, which is why I thought it could've meant a video tutorial.

I clicked the link and it led me to an article. So, _read_ should have been the word used in this context. It leaves no room for doubt. It tells me that the link would 100% lead me to a text documentation, and I wouldn't have to worry about a video auto-playing and blasting cheesy intro music. Links are a crucial part of documentation, so their wording should be clear.
