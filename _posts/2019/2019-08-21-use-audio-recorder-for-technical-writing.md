title: Why using a voice recorder will make you a better technical writer
categories: [Communication, Documentation]

As a documentarian, I sometimes need to interview subject matter experts (SMEs). My hand-writing is fast but not fast enough. In some cases, I won't be able to have my laptop with me. What would I always have? My smartphone. And what's a smartphone good for if not to keep track of things like audio? A voice recorder app plus note-taking ensures I won't miss important details of a system or product I'm documenting.

My problem is that some colleagues are uncomfortable about having their voices recorded. So, I asked the Write the Docs community on how to approach this.




swapnil_ogale: Yes. I've interviewed technical SMEs before with a voice recorder. This helped me to pick up finer workings of a system I was documenting. Helps me going back to them all the time when I can listen to the interview and get info from that.

technicalleigh: I have, yes. The SMEs were cooperative because I made it clear to them that they could say no, but also explained that it was so I could respect their time by getting the most out of the meeting and not having to come ask them the same questions again. I also made a commitment to not share the recording with anyone else and to delete the recording as soon as I finished using it.

swapnil_ogale: Also, I know of other tech writers who recorded SMEs which helped them avoid miscommunication in the future when things changed and were not communicated to tech writers.

dgolds: One of the writers I work with regularly does. Not my thing, but it works for her.
