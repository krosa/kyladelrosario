title: Designing buttons in a user guide
categories: Documentation

Someone on the Write the Docs Slack community asked for advice on designing buttons in a user guide. Her three options were:

1. Quotes (e.g., Click "OK")
2. Brackets (e.g., Click [OK])
3. Bold font (e.g., Click **OK**)

Everyone who responded advised the writer to use option three. This also corresponds to Microsoft Style Guide's short [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/b/button) about the button. Microsoft Style Guide goes further and suggests we avoid using the word _button_ in our writing, but if it's necessary to add the word for clarity, _button_ should be lowercase.
