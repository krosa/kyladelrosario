title: Miles to go before I sleep

One of my favourite poems is Robert Frost's "Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening." The last stanza, in particular, resonates with me:

> The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.

My work is never done. There's always a new project to complete, a new dream to chase, and places to be. I have responsibilities. It's wonderful to take part in the world, so as much as I need to rest, there's still a long way to go. This what I need to do:

* Work in a career that I love so it won't feel like work at all
* Make enough money to help out my family
* Earn more certifications to improve my technical skills
* Master another language. I'm currently learning Spanish
* Travel to Asia and Europe (when the coronavirus is gone)
* Get back into old hobbies like improv, calligraphy, and needle felting
* Be content with what I've accomplished

The last item may never happen, but that's okay. Without the satisfaction of completion, I'll always find room to improve and do more with my life.
