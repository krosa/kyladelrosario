title: We moved to Calgary
categories: Life
---

My boyfriend and I moved to Calgary from Vancouver for many reasons. Starting over was one of them. When a door opened, who were we to refuse to enter? Of course, it hasn't been without its challenges. The economy's not the best, so I've taken on a survival job alongside some freelance gigs. I also completed an intensive IT training program, as Calgary is struggling to fill several IT roles. It'll be an interesting year for sure.

So far, here's what I love about our new life in Calgary:
* Kind relatives who took care of us when we arrived
* Easy access to the C-train
* Beautiful and affordable apartment
* Wonderful view of the skyline, sunrise, and sunset
* New friends who fill our life with social events
* Endless opportunities, as long as we remain flexible

This year, I want to be able to transition to a Junior IT Analyst role, while still keeping up with technical writing and UX design. As long as these various fields help me become a well-rounded employee, I find no reason to let them go.

What I'll miss about our old life in Vancouver:
* Immediate family members
* Access to Stanley Park and False Creek
* Improv on Granville Island
* Wonderful view of the mountains
* Irreplaceable friends from school
* Belgian hot chocolate from Blenz (N/A in Calgary)

Sometimes homesickness hits hard. Thankfully I can email and videocall anyone anytime. When I have enough money, I can visit. Good thing Vancouver is just the next province away.
