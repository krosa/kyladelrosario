Pessimism is "safe." It's a protective bubble that prevents us from disappointment. It's a quick fix in a seemingly depressing world.

_"Yeah, I don't think I got that job." or_

_"I guess all that effort was for nothing." or_

_"It's fine. We're all going to die anyway."_

I'm not advocating for blind optimism. Acknowledging that sometimes things aren't okay is fine. But assuming that nothing is or ever will is harmful. Let's fill our lives with a bit of hope that will propel is into action.
