Calgary rests 1,048 metres above the sea level. This high altitude results in low air pressure, which makes cooking a wee bit longer than I'm used to. I honestly forgot about this when I moved here, so the first time my hard-boiled eggs came out soft came as a surprise. Back in Vancouver, I had it down perfectly. I thought I was losing my touch.

So, to spare you from cooking gaffes in front of company or the sound of own your voice screaming, "What did I do wrong?!", here are some tips on how to cook in high altitude:

1. **Thaw food before cooking.** Thaw food to make sure it cooks thoroughly when tossed on the pan or grill. _Note: Even if you don't live in a high-altitude city, do this anyway! Why wouldn't you? Too lazy? No excuse._

2. **Increase cooking time.** Since cooking takes longer in this environment, increase cooking time to compensate.

3. **Increase cooking liquid.** Lower atmospheric pressure decreases the boiling point of water, so liquid evaporates faster and food may dry out faster.

4. **Grill over lower heat.** This prevents food from drying out and burning.

5. **Use a meat thermometer.** It's easy to overcook meat, so use a meat thermometer to ensure proper internal temperature.

Good luck. Have a good meal.
