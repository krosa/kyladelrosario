It's been a pleasure to read many library books in 2018. I wouldn't have made it through my long commutes without the Libby app. Here they are, in the order in which I read them:

* Haruki Murakami, _The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_
* Nadja Spiegelman, _I'm Supposed to Protect You from All of This_
* Patti Smith, _Just Kids_
* Patti Smith, _M Train_
* Anthony Bourdain, _Kitchen Confidential_
* Josh Bernoff, _Writing Without Bullshit_
* Thich Nhat Hanh, _Art of Mindful Living_
* Cait Flanders, _The Year of Less_
* Eckhart Tolle, _A New Earth_
* Amy Tan, _The Joy Luck Club_
* Joelle Charbonneau, _The Testing_
* Joelle Charbonneau, _Independent Study_
* Joelle Charbonneau, _Graduation Day_
* Shirley Jackson, _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_
* Thich Nhat Hanh, _How to Relax_
* Ryan Holiday, _The Obstacle is the Way_
* Ryan Holiday, _Ego is the Enemy_
* Gillian Flynn, _Sharp Objects_
* Celeste Ng, _Everything I Never Told You_
* Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations: A New Translation_

I'm currently finishing Thomas McNamee's _The Inner Life of Cats: The Science and Secrets of Our Mysterious Feline Companions_. I find comfort in it while I grieve the death of my family's cat, Cici. She had many happy years with us.
