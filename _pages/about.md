## About me

I have over six years of experience in designing intuitive web and mobile user interfaces. This has enhanced my creativity, empathy, and logicâ€”skills necessary to be a successful problem-solver. Currently, I participate in NPower Canada's Junior IT Analyst Program, learning about operating systems, applications, tools, project management, and languages required in information technology.

Ever since I was a child, I possessed an inherent desire to improve myself and assist the people around me achieve their goals. As an adult, my mission is simple: to make users more efficient and effective at what they do. Combining troubleshooting, business analysis, and documentation, I strive to make everyone's job easier so they can be better workers.

I started this site as a blog where I could document what I've learned and what I'm currently learning.
