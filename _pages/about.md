## About me

Calgary-based aspiring IT professional who enjoys troubleshooting, technical writing, film, and theatre. Documentation, design, and dinner make up my life.

## About this site

This started as a GitHub practice for Git, HTML, SASS, and Jekyll. Now it's turning into a writer's playground with no defined shape or form.
