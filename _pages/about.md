## About me

I'm a technical writer/UX designer based in Vancouver, Canada. I write and edit documentation that is easy for people to read, understand, and follow.  

When I'm away from my computer, I write in my journal with my growing collection of fountain pens. Whenever possible, I also engage in public storytelling and improv comedy.  

## About this site

I started this site as a blog where I could document my thoughts on writing, editing, designing, and living. I try to learn new things every day, and I'd like to share these with you.
