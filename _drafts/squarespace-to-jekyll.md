## From Squarespace to Jekyll

Last year, I switched my blog from Squarespace (pre-made website templates) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (static-site generator). Squarespace, though beautiful and easy to use, was not the best choice for a young technical writer.

Squarespace's Markdown block is small and slow, especially when I'm writing longer posts. Jekyll, on the other hand, is lightning-fast. I can create a quick .md file, and boom, I'm in business.

Jekyll is also a good alternative for traditional help-authoring tools like Flare and RoboHelp. Running my blog on Jekyll allows me to practice anytime and anywhere I want.

Finally, I can host the site for free on GitHub. It only costs me to use my domain name, but Namecheap is affordable. I pay less now than when I ran my blog on Squarespace.

Since I hadn't written enough technical writing blog posts on Squarespace, I didn't feel the need to export my site as an XML file. I opted to start fresh, just as I was transitioning from UX designer to a tech writer/UX designer hybrid.

## Creating a Jekyll blog

I'm no web designer. When I thought of moving my site to Jekyll, I never planned on designing the site from scratch, so I chose to fork an existing Jekyll theme repo that I found on GitHub.

### Tools

* GitHub
* Git
* Jekyll
* Domain name registrar (e.g., Namecheap)
* Text editor (e.g., Atom)

### Steps

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
4. On GitHub, Fork your favourite Jekyll theme. I chose [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale).
5.
